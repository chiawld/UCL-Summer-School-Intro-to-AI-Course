    "1. **Execute cells sequentially** - Click the play button (▶️) or use `Shift + Enter`\n",
    "2. **Wait for completion** - Let each cell finish before proceeding\n",
    "3. **Ignore warnings** - Most are informational and won't affect functionality\n",
    "4. **Experiment freely** - Feel free to modify parameters and try different inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Tips:\n",
    "- **Runtime menu**: Use \"Restart and run all\" if you need a fresh start\n",
    "- **Save your work**: File → Save a copy in Drive\n",
    "- **GPU acceleration**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (if available)\n",
