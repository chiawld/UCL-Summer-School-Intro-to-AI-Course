# What is AI: Introduction & brief history

* keywords: autonomous, similar abilities to humans, enable problem-solving, making predictions, learning from the past
* 1950s AI > 1980s Machine Learning > 2010s Deep Learning
    * ML = subset of AI, AI techniques
        * DL = subset of ML, much more powerful
* AI without ML = classical 'AI', rule-based systems, today still in some chatbots (natural language processing)
* usefulness of AI: complex data analysis, predictive analysis, automation, personalisation, advanced data handling
    * recognising patterns in data; esp. for tasks which are very large / difficult for humans

## A brief history
* 1957 idea of mimicking the human brain structure - perceptron = take signals from many neurons around them, transmit signals along axon
* 1980s parallel computing - architecture similar to modern GPUs
* 2006 first visual database
* 2009 the idea of using GPUs to train large neural networks
* 2013 DeepMind introduced deep reinforcement learning

-> today: GenAI Agents
* ChatGPT uses token APIs to search the internet (limited to websites that allow these tokens) - GenAI Agents browse the internet, search more similarly to how we do
* possible: multi-agent models (parallel search), e.g., each agent is a different person in the team

## Concepts in AI
* Machine Learning: [supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning] > deep learning
    * deep learning can do all the same as ML, but in a more powerful way - modules (like neurons) are bigger
    * main tasks: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning

### What is Machine Learning?
* training a computer to do a task, the more data you give - the more accurate
- Tasks:
1. supervised learning: regression (predicting trends + future values) & classification (labelling)
2. unsupervised learning: clustering
3. reinforcement learning: agent + environment; environment > state + reward > agent > actions > ...

### What is Deep Learning?
* multi-layer artificial neural networks to imitate the way a human brain learns
* process unstructured data (e.g., images, text)
* allows feature extraction (converting raw data into numerical values while preserving patterns)

### What is Natural Language Processing?
= Computer Science + AI + Computational Linguistics
* study of interaction between computer & human languages, sub-field of AI
* goal: build intelligent computer that can interact with humans like a human
language > [understanding NLU] computer [generation NLG] > language

### Further terms
* big data: data with large volume & challenging variety (for data processing systems)
* neural network: computational approach that loosely models how the brain solves problems, layers of inputs and outputs, networks are trained over many iterations
* intelligent agents: human, robot, software; can perceive environment through sensors and act upon environment through actuators
